# Git Workflow

**Author:** _Francis Agustin_

**Due date:** _February 9, 2016_

## Description

_Our assignment was to edit this README file from the repository._

## What I Learned from This

_We learned how to open a repository to fetch our homework, save it onto our local drive, edit it, and push it back onto GitHub._

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

_Francis Agustin_
